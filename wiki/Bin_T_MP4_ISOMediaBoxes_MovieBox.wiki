 Type: [Bin_T_MP4_AtomicInfo AtomicInfo][**] — a series of other atoms

 The movie atom contains other types of atoms, including at least one of three possible atoms — the [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_MovieHeaderBox movie header atom] ({{{'mvhd'}}}), the compressed movie atom ({{{'cmov'}}}), or a reference movie atom ({{{'rmra'}}}). An uncompressed movie atom can contain both a movie header atom and a reference movie atom, but it must contain at least one of the two. It can also contain several other atoms, such as a clipping atom ({{{'clip'}}}), one or more [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_TrackBox track atoms] ({{{'trak'}}}), a color table atom ({{{'ctab'}}}), and a [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_UserDataBox user data atom] ({{{'udta'}}}). 


== Remarks ==

The metadata for a presentation is stored in the single Movie box which occurs at the top-level of a file. Normally this box is close to the beginning or end of the file, though this is not required.

You use movie atoms to specify the information that defines a movie—that is, the information that allows your application to interpret the sample data that is stored elsewhere. The movie atom usually contains a movie header atom, which defines the time scale and duration information for the entire movie, as well as its display characteristics. Existing movies may contain a movie profile atom, which summarizes the main features of the movie, such as the necessary codecs and maximum bit rate. In addition, the movie atom contains a track atom for each track in the movie.

The movie atom has an atom type of {{{'moov'}}}.
