The movie atom contains other types of atoms, including at least one of three possible atoms — the [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_MovieHeaderBox movie header atom] ({{{'mvhd'}}}), the compressed movie atom ({{{'cmov'}}}), or a reference movie atom ({{{'rmra'}}}). An uncompressed movie atom can contain both a movie header atom and a reference movie atom, but it must contain at least one of the two. It can also contain several other atoms, such as a clipping atom ({{{'clip'}}}), one or more [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_TrackBox track atoms] ({{{'trak'}}}), a color table atom ({{{'ctab'}}}), and a [T_MP4_ISOMediaBoxes_UserDataBox user data atom] ({{{'udta'}}}).
