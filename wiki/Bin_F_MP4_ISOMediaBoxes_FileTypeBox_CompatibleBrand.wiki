If none of the compatible brands fields is set to {{{'qt '}}}, then the file is not a !QuickTime movie file. !QuickTime currently returns an error when attempting to open a file whose file type, file extension, or MIME type identifies it as a !QuickTime movie, but whose file type atom does not include the {{{'qt '}}}brand.

MPEG-4 files are automatically imported by !QuickTime only when they are correctly identified as MPEG-4 files using the Mac OS file type, file extension, or MIME type.
