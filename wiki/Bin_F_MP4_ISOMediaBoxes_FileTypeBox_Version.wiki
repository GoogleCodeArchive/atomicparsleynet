The minor version is informative only. It does not appear for compatible-brands, and must not be used to determine the conformance of a file to a standard. It may allow more precise identification of the major specification, for inspection, debugging, or improved decoding.

For !QuickTime movie files, this takes the form of four binary-coded decimal values, indicating the century, year, and month of the _!QuickTime File Format Specification_, followed by a binary coded decimal zero. For example, for the June 2004 minor version, this field is set to the BCD values {{{20 04 06 00}}}.
